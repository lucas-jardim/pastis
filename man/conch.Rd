\title{mrBayes output interrogator (COnstraint CHecker)}
\usage{
conch(
  constraint_tree,
  mrbayes_output,
  simple_edge_scaling = TRUE,
  species_set = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{constraint_tree}{the constraint tree used with pastis (either the filename or ape phylo tree)}

\item{mrbayes_output}{the mrBayes output .t file (either the filename or ape multiPhylo tree object)}

\item{simple_edge_scaling}{boolean, see function description}

\item{species_set}{if specified, this should be a list of species and output trees will only be generated for these species (the default is all missing species)}
}
\value{
NULL. A file for each missing taxon is created in the current directory
}
\description{
This function examines mrBayes output from a pastis run to examine where in
the original constraint tree missing taxa have been placed
}
\details{
An analysis of the placement of each taxon not contained in the constraint tree is 
conducted. For each such taxon the edge lengths in the constraint tree are adjusted
according to the parameter edge_scaling. If simple_edge_scaling is TRUE, the edges
will have length 0 if a taxon is never descendant from a tree and 1 if it is descendant 
in at least one tree. If FALSE, indicate the proportion of sampled trees in which the 
taxon is descendant from that edge. 

The output from this function is useful for checking that missing taxa are placed in
appropriate positions relative to the original constraint tree.

Note that this routine has not been optimised and slow (possibly unacceptable) 
performance is to be expected with large trees and/or large posterior samples.
